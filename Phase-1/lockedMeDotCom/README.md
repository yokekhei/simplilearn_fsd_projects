The application allows users to manipulate files in the user directory. The generic features and three main operations are:
1. Retrieving the file names in an ascending order
2. Business-level operations:
    - Option to add a user specified file to the application
    - Option to delete a user specified file from the application
    - Option to search a user specified file from the application
    - Navigation option to close the current execution context and return to main context
3. Option to close the application

As this is a prototyped application, the user interaction is via a command line. It runs and displays output on the console terminal window.
